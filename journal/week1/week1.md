# Week 1 â€” App Containerization
Containerization is a way of packaging software code along with all its dependencies into a single, isolated, and portable executable unit called a container. Here I will use Docker for containize the application. Docker is a tool that allows developers to create and manage containers that encapsulate their applications and dependencies. 
## Our applicaion was developed with React(frontend) and flask(backend). The steps are below:

  1. Run back server
  2. Create Docker file (for backend) 
  3. Run image in Docker container
  4. Create Docker file (for frontend) 
  5. Run images in Docker container 
  6. Create Docker compose fiel
  7. Create PostGress 


### As the application develped with Python(backend) we should run python 
   "python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567"
          ```sh
          cd backend-flask
          export FRONTEND_URL="*"
          export BACKEND_URL="*"
          python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567
          cd ..
          ```
- make sure to unlock the port on the port tab
- open the link for 4567 in your browser
- append to the url to `/api/activities/home`
- you should get back json in browser and get response 200 in terminal

  
###  Create docker file for Backend.
  1. change diractory into the backend file and create a docker file name"Dockerfile" (don't forget to install docker extension, https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/overview)
  2. The docker file include the image that we gonna use . for this we go to docker hub and find related images that we need. 
          1. source -> mainly docker hub 
                FROM   <the images with version>   =>  < debian:bullseye-slim > 
          2. point the diractory -> the application where the applicaion containerized 
                WORKDIR / workdirectory 
          3. Map envirenment path 
                ENV FLASK_ENV=development  ||  ENT  PATH ="./backend/.bin:$PATH
          4. Copy across everthing in the target path
                COPY ..
          5.  Run the imgage 
                RUN <file || command>
          6.  configuration 
                CMD ["image","<tag>", "<command>", "<port>"] 

  for python:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster
WORKDIR /backend-flask
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
ENV FLASK_ENV=development
EXPOSE ${PORT}
CMD [ "python3", "-m" , "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=4567"] 
```


### Build Container 
  after created docker file we build docker container with "docker build --tag <tag name> ."  command

```sh
docker build -t  backend-flask ./backend-flask
```

### Now we run the container with 

Run 
```sh
docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it backend-flask
FRONTEND_URL="*" BACKEND_URL="*" docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it backend-flask
export FRONTEND_URL="*"
export BACKEND_URL="*"
docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it  -e FRONTEND_URL -e BACKEND_URL backend-flask
// combined version
docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it -e FRONTEND_URL='*' -e BACKEND_URL='*' backend-flask
unset FRONTEND_URL="*"
unset BACKEND_URL="*"
```

Run in background
```sh
docker container run --rm -p 4567:4567 -d backend-flask
```

Return the container id into an Env Var
```sh
CONTAINER_ID=$(docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -d backend-flask)
```

> docker container run is idiomatic, docker run is legacy syntax but is commonly used.

### Get Container Images or Running Container Ids
```
docker ps
docker ps -a  // include non active servers
docker images
```


### Send Curl to Test Server

```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:4567/api/activities/home -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Check Container Logs

```sh
docker logs [OPTIONS] CONTAINER  
docker logs webserver  //to view the logs of a container named "webserver"
docker logs CONTAINER_ID -f //If you want to see the logs as they are generated in real-time
docker logs backend-flask -f
docker logs $CONTAINER_ID -f
```

###  Debugging  adjacent containers with other containers

```sh
docker run --rm -it curlimages/curl "-X GET http://localhost:4567/api/activities/home -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\""
```

busybosy is often used for debugging since it install a bunch of thing

```sh
docker run --rm -it busybosy
```

### Gain Access to a Container

```sh
docker exec CONTAINER_ID -it /bin/bash
```

> You can just right click a container and see logs in VSCode with Docker extension

### Delete an Image

```sh
docker image rm backend-flask --force
```

> docker rmi backend-flask is the legacy syntax, you might see this is old docker tutorials and articles.

> There are some cases where you need to use the --force

### Overriding Ports

```sh
FLASK_ENV=production PORT=8080 docker run -p 4567:4567 -it backend-flask
```

> Look at Dockerfile to see how ${PORT} is interpolated

## Containerize Frontend

## Run NPM Install

We have to run NPM Install before building the container since it needs to copy the contents of node_modules

```
cd frontend-react-js
npm i
```

### Create Docker File

Create a file here: `frontend-react-js/Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
FROM node:16.18

ENV PORT=3000

COPY . /frontend-react-js
WORKDIR /frontend-react-js
RUN npm install
EXPOSE ${PORT}
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Build Container

```sh
docker build -t frontend-react-js ./frontend-react-js
```

### Run Container

```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d frontend-react-js
```

## Multiple Containers

### Create a docker-compose file

Create `docker-compose.yml` at the root of your project.

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  backend-flask:
    environment:
      FRONTEND_URL: "https://3000-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
      BACKEND_URL: "https://4567-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
    build: ./backend-flask
    ports:
      - "4567:4567" //we can change the port 
    volumes:   #it is container directory that we gonna map
      - ./backend-flask:/backend-flask
  frontend-react-js:
    environment:
      REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL: "https://4567-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
    build: ./frontend-react-js
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./frontend-react-js:/frontend-react-js

# the name flag is a hack to change the default prepend folder
# name when outputting the image names
networks: 
  internal-network:
    driver: bridge
    name: cruddur
```

## Adding DynamoDB Local and Postgres

We are going to use Postgres and DynamoDB local in future labs
We can bring them in as containers and reference them externally

Lets integrate the following into our existing docker compose file:

### Postgres

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:13-alpine
    restart: always
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
    volumes: 
      - db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
volumes:
  db:
    driver: local
```

To install the postgres client into Gitpod

```sh
  - name: postgres
    init: |
      curl -fsSL https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc|sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/postgresql.gpg
      echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ `lsb_release -cs`-pgdg main" |sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install -y postgresql-client-13 libpq-dev
```

### DynamoDB Local

```yaml
services:
  dynamodb-local:
    # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67533058/persist-local-dynamodb-data-in-volumes-lack-permission-unable-to-open-databa
    # We needed to add user:root to get this working.
    user: root
    command: "-jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -sharedDb -dbPath ./data"
    image: "amazon/dynamodb-local:latest"
    container_name: dynamodb-local
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - "./docker/dynamodb:/home/dynamodblocal/data"
    working_dir: /home/dynamodblocal
```

Example of using DynamoDB local
https://github.com/100DaysOfCloud/challenge-dynamodb-local

## Volumes

directory volume mapping

```yaml
volumes: 
- "./docker/dynamodb:/home/dynamodblocal/data"
```

named volume mapping

```yaml
volumes: 
  - db:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db:
    driver: local
```
